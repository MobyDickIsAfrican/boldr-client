### AWS Newsletter

## Description
This is a react.js client api that allows a user to subscribe to a newsletter. The backend api is built entirely on AWS, using API Gateway, Lamda and DynanamoDB for the storage component. Emails are validated according to the RFC 5322 Format on the client API as well as on the backend. Validation of uniqueness is also performed to ensure there are no duplicate emails.
